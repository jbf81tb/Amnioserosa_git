# 3D tracking from layers of 2D tracking
There is an obvious way to translate objects tracked in two adjacent planes into a 3D represenation. For each object, you compare its position to the position of every object in the adjacent plane and connect it to the nearest one. However, this strategy can be both memory intensive and computationally intensive. In order to speed things up, I localized each object so a single pixel. Each object is assigned a prime number. 

I create two versions of each frame. In one version the objects are represented by a 1 while the rest of the space is repsented with a zero. In the other version each object is represented with its prime number. For the first version I add two adjacent frames together with an elementwise operation. Finally, I look for pixels that result in a 2 which means that each frame had that object. Finally, I multiply the second version of frames together with an elementwise operation. Because this version contained prime numbers, their product can be quickly factored to obtain the constituent parts. With this strategy, I don't have to keep track of indeces. All of the information is contained in the pixels, and all of the operations are extremely fast.
